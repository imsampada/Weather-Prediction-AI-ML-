# Weather-Prediction-AI-ML-
The past developments in the predictability of weather and climate are discussed from the point of view of nonlinear dynamical systems. The sensitive dependence of chaos on initial conditions and the imperfections in the models limit reliable predictability of the instantaneous state of the weather to less than 10 days in present-day operational forecasts. But regional and short-term weather and climate prediction are also essential for communities to prepare and adapt to rapidly changing weather conditions and climate variability. So this project is based on Python-based ml model which focuses on developing accurate and reliable models for short-term regional weather forecasting using historicalÂ data
